## 🧩 Async Rendering of an Entire Section via CMS

Async Render is a way to implement lazy loading for a section. The Lazy section (website/sections/Rendering/Lazy.tsx) is responsible for implementing the mechanism
that prevents the section from being rendered on the server and makes a request to the server for the section. If the section exports a component called `LoadingFallback`, it will be rendered
by Lazy on the server, which is useful for displaying spinners or small parts of the section.

### When to use it?

Ideal for sections that are **below the fold**.

> NOTE: If you have access to a tool for navigating pages, NAVIGATE and identify which sections are below the fold.

### Step by Step

Edit the CMS page content, composing the Lazy section with the section that already exists on the page.

#### Before (without async render):

```json
// page json with CMS Content
{
  "sections": [
    { "__resolveType": "...", // component props }
  ]
}
```

#### After (with async render):

```json
{
// page json with CMS Content
  "sections": [
    {
      "__resolveType": "website/sections/Rendering/Lazy.tsx",
      "section": {
        "__resolveType": "...",
        // component props
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

> NOTE: It's possible to create and export a LoadingFallback component in the section, which will be rendered while the section component (default function) is loading.
