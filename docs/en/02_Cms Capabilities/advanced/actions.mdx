description: Actions (execution of actions)
since: 2.0

Actions represent functions that are typically invoked by users in the browser.
For example, signing up for a newsletter, adding an item to a shopping cart, or
any operation that requires server intervention.

In the platform, you can test such actions, or even have actions that are only
executed in this administrative interface.

Unlike sections and loaders, it is possible to save pre-configured entities, but
there is not much usefulness in this. In this sense, by accessing the sidebar
`Advanced > Actions`, you will have access to the actions library and the
ability to create, save, edit, and execute existing actions.

The different categories present in the listing are obtained from the directory
where the action is located or from the originating **App** (an **App** can
import different actions).

From this screen, you can:

- **Saved**: List saved actions
- **Library**: List and test all available actions for use
- **Create new Action**: Create new actions

## Listing and testing actions

When listing actions in the library, and when clicking on an action, you gain
access to a preview of the Action, as well as access to the original code of
that element. It is also possible to edit the code to test changes in the
functionality of the component.

In the right sidebar, you can access:

- `üåê` Element preview
- `‚ò∞` Form with properties
- `{}` Textual description of properties
- `</>` Code editor
- `üñ•Ô∏è` Logs related to the loader preview
- `‚ú®` Decopilot: AI for code modification

## Create new Action

It is possible to create a saved action or the base (template) of an action.

- **Create template**: Creates an action that will be available in the component
  library. This means creating a code base that will define a set of properties
  and a program to return data.
- **Using a template**: Creates a saved action from an existing base. The name
  will be the identification of this element.
