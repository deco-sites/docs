## The Old Web is broken, complicated and fragmented.

For the last 10 years, our team built high-volume, mission-critical websites and
applications. We tested out most new frameworks and frontend architectures from
KnockoutJS to React to GraphQL. Reflecting on our challenges and results, we
believe <u>the current state of web development is broken</u>:

<div>

üß© <u>The complexity to build and deploy a web application has grown</u>
steadily, discouraging junior developers from building the web.

üòì <u>Developers and content creators often struggle to collaborate</u> because
the Headless CMS becomes a silo, requiring a lot of time to integrate and
evolve;

üê¢ <u>Client-side-first apps have terrible performance for high-volume</u>,
content-driven websites like ecommerce storefronts, shipping ever-growing
amounts of JavaScript code.

</div>

We wanted a simpler way for web developers to build and collaborate with their
marketing peers, using modern web technologies, and without having to configure
so much stuff. "No-code" is not enough, and often removes power from developers.
We wanted to have one environment from code to content to data. We wanted to
build the other side of code, a collaborative experience builder for developers
and content creators to work together in.

## Making webdev straightforward for teams of all sizes

That's why we created deco.cx: a complete webdev platform for developers and
content teams to build collaborative experiences together. <u>Developers write
components and functions using Deno, JSX, HTMX, TypeScript, and Tailwind</u>. We
automatically generate a beautiful, visual admin UI from the TypeScript code!

Forget the costly and complex setup of a Headless CMS, or the inflexible
structure of a no-code prison. deco.cx offers a seamless solution, making webdev
straightforward for teams of all sizes:
