description: Adding an App
since: 1.33.2

In this documentation, we will guide you through adding an `App` to your site.
An `App` allows you to easily integrate new functionalities, sections, and
features into your site.

## 1. Access the Apps Page

To add an app to your site, click on the Apps tab. You will see a list of all
available apps. In this case, we will add the Weather App.

## 2. Install the App

Click on the switch button to install the app on your site.

![Install app](/docs/getting-started/adding-an-app/install-app.png)

The Weather App provides a section that displays a message with the current
temperature. Besides the section, this app also includes a loader, a TypeScript
function that returns data typically needed in a Section. This specific loader
retrieves the temperature of a given location (or the current location if no
location is specified). Let's use both and see how they can be integrated.

## 3. Use the App's Functionalities

### 3.1 Go to the WhatsTheTemperature Section

Navigate to the Sections Page and click on the WhatsTheTemperature Section. You
can filter the list by the app.

![Sections Page](/docs/getting-started/adding-an-app/sections-page.png)

Open the section properties. The only property this section has is a
temperature, which is a number representing the temperature in Celsius.

### 3.2 Configure the Section to Use the App's Loader

Click on the Temperature field to choose how you will provide the temperature
information.

![Select Temperature Source](/docs/getting-started/adding-an-app/select-source.png)

You have three options:

1. **Manual Entry**: Provide an arbitrary number for the temperature.

2. **Default Value**: Leave the temperature field blank. The section accepts a
   null value, and a default fixed temperature will be displayed.

3. **Use the Loader**: Utilize the loader made available by the Weather App.

   ![Use the Loader](/docs/getting-started/adding-an-app/use-loader.png)

   If you do not provide latitude and longitude, the loader will fetch the
   temperature of your current location. Alternatively, providing the latitude
   and longitude of a specific place will return the current temperature for
   that location:

   > Looks like itâ€™s a bit cold in Greenland.

## 4. Use the Section in Your Pages

Now you can use the configured section in your site pages just like you did in
[a previous tutorial](/docs/en/getting-started/creating-a-new-page). That's it!
Enjoy exploring this and other apps on deco.cx!
