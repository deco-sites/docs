# Private Apps in Deco.cx

This guide will walk you through the process of creating and integrating a private app in your Deco.cx project.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have:
- Created your app
- Uploaded it to GitHub
- Made the repository private
- Invited the deco-bot to your repository
- Notified Deco about the private app invitation

## Integration Steps

### 1. Add the App as a Submodule

Add your private app repository as a Git submodule:

```bash
git submodule add https://github.com/github-user-or-organization/your-private-app.git $APP_NAME
```

### 2. Configure Import Path

Create an entry in your `deno.json` file in the imports section:

```json
{
  "imports": {
    "$APP_NAME": "$APP_NAME"
  }
}
```


### 3. Create App Entry Point

Create a file at `/apps/$APP_NAME.ts` with the following content:

```ts
export { default } from "$APP_NAME/mod.ts";
export * from "$APP_NAME/mod.ts";
```

### 4. Create App Block

create a file at `.deco/blocks/$APP_NAME.json` with the following content:

```json
{
  "__resolveType": "site/apps/$APP_NAME.ts"
}
```


## Completion

Once you've completed these steps, your private app will be available for use in your Deco.cx project.
