The `home` represents the user's initial space. From this screen, it is possible
to access sites, teams, as well as the deco documentation itself.

## Command Bar

On the home page, and throughout the use of the admin, a `command bar` will
always be available in the top bar of the screen. The command bar operates
according to the open context. On the `home` page, it allows searching for and
opening user sites and teams.

In addition, it is possible to perform specific commands. The following commands
are available on the `home` page:

- **/open**: to open sites or teams (default command when selecting a team or
  site from the search)
- **/delete**: to delete sites or teams

## Profile

In addition to the `command bar`, it is always possible to access your user
profile from any space in the admin. To do this, access your user photo in the
upper right corner.

In it, it is possible to define settings regarding your profile (including your
photo), payment details (for users who perform tasks), and an API key for admin
usage.

### API Key (Dev)

The API Key allows you to perform operations in the admin (loaders and actions)
with the permissions of your user. In the request for admin loaders/actions,
define the `x-api-key` header that is provided on this screen.
