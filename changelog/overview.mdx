<Update label="January 2025">
  ## Form select now keeps the correct type
    <Frame>
    <img src="/images/changelog/2025-jan-rjsf.png" alt="Form Selection" />
    </Frame> 
    Some types, such as the product listing page properties type selection, are now **correctly selected**.

    This issue was caused by three main problems:
    - RJSF was unable to distinguish between properties that have multiple types (e.g., `[string, number]`).
    - There was an issue with schemas generated from apps before version 0.64.21, where a property type such as `[]` (empty array) was not allowed.
    - RJSF didn't correctly cache a root schema with `$id`, as it also needed to cache the same root schema with `ROOT_SCHEMA_PREFIX` as the id.

    If you are still experiencing issues with this bug, please **update to the latest version of the app**.

  ## AI Input form fill
    <Frame>
    <img src="/images/changelog/2025-jan-aiinput.png" alt="AI Inputs" />
    </Frame> 
    We added a tool for select input that uses contextual information to generate text.

    Under the hood, we use the Sonnet 3.5 model to generate information, expanding the prompt by extracting context from the page itself.

    An additional prompt can be used to improve the result of the task. A diff between the current input and the proposed AI input is shown before confirmation.

    For each string property, you can use the `@aiContext` annotation to provide additional context for the user.

    We aim to expand this utility across all our products and allow your own AI apps to edit and create data for your site!

  ## Webdrawm in admin
    <Frame>
    <img src="/images/changelog/2025-jan-webdraw.png" alt="Webdraw" />
    </Frame> 
    Introducing Webdraw! This new tool allows you to create AI-driven sections directly within our admin interface.

    To create a section, use Webdraw and press `âŒ˜ (CTRL) + P` to push your section to the admin and start using it.

    You may need a tailored prompt to achieve the best results. For example, you can copy the code from an existing section as a reference.

    We have made our default [deco prompt available here](https://gist.github.com/matheusgr/bbdcab6747cccb83e18254304d0970fc).

    Please note that AI may sometimes generate invalid TSX code, so some manual adjustments might be necessary.

    <Warning>Note: This feature is still experimental!</Warning>
