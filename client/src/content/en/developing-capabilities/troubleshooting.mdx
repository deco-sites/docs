## Problems running deno locally

When running the project locally, `deno` displays errors or problems when
executing the site.

### Update deno

Run the following command to update deno to the latest version...

`deno upgrade`

In some very specific cases, you can also test other versions of deno by
specifying a version to update to...

`deno upgrade --version X.Y.Z`

### Clear the deno cache

Deno is efficient at aggressively caching dependencies so that the time to
restart the server is very fast. At the same time, cached dependencies may have
problems or errors in the downloaded versions.

Therefore, we recommend clearing the cache of related files:

`deno cache -r dev.ts main.ts`

In case of errors related to typing or execution elements, also try clearing the
local storage:

`deno eval 'localStorage.clear()'`

Depending on the installation and configuration of the site, deno may pull npm
dependencies into the "node_modules" directory. Deleting this directory can
resolve issues related to npm dependencies.

### Check if another application is running on port 8000

If another application is running on port 8000, the deno process may enter a
"loop" or fail to start on that port. Check if there are other applications
running on port 8000.

## My changes were not reflected on the production site

### Check if the deploy was successful

In the site repository, check for a marker on the last _commit_. The _deploy_
must have been successful for the code to be considered in production:

![Successful deploy](https://github.com/deco-sites/starting/assets/882438/6f4e853f-23bf-4ed1-9f4f-b16a97690a6a).

In case of failure, hover over the error indication to see an indication of the
problem.

If the system failed in our infrastructure, you can send an empty commit to
force a new _deploy_ with the command:

`git commit --allow-empty -n -m "Redeploy"`

### Check the environment selector

Check if the environment selector (preview) points to the correct address.

## I have errors in a specific section, page, or functionality

### Update deco and std

New versions of the deco framework and std bring fixes for common project
issues:

`deno eval 'import "deco/scripts/update.ts"'`

## A component is not interactive, the click/button doesn't work

Every interactive component must be an island. For this, it must be inside the
`islands/` folder and cannot be in a sub-folder.

If any JS loading fails in the browser, components may lose interactivity. Open
the `console.log` to look for JS errors.
